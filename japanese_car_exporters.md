# Japanese Car Exporters

## What is a Car Exporter?

Japanese car auctions are not open to the general public and require a licensed dealer to participate. A Japanese car exporter is a licensed company that acts as your intermediary, providing access to multiple auction houses across Japan.

## My Experience with Japanese Car Exporters

In each case, I imported a Nissan Note e-Power 2023 directly from auction as a private individual (not a company).

### Exporter 1: auXXXXXXXXXjp

- Service fees + freight (RORO) for Nissan Note: ¥366200 (December 2025)

- Russian-speaking support available
- Shipping time: 24-48 days from auction win to RORO departure:
  - My December import: 30 days from auction to RORO departure
  - My January import: 48 days from auction to RORO departure

- Limited to 5 active bids at a time — restrictive if you want to bid on multiple cars
- Web portal is not user-friendly, though still manageable
- I often experience delays in getting responses from the manager.


### Exporter 2: mdXXXXXXXXom

- Service fees + freight (RORO) for Nissan Note: ¥411000 (August 2025) - approximately €240 more expensive than Exporter 1

- No limits for active bids. More user-friendly web portal
- Helpful statistics showing historical auction prices

- Long shipping time in my case — 54 days from auction to RORO departure. The company noted this was an unusual delay.


## Stock vs Auction Purchase

Most exporters offer two options: buying from stock or bidding at auction.

### Buying from Stock

**What it is:** Pre-purchased vehicles that the exporter already owns and has in their inventory. These cars were typically bought at previous auctions or from dealers.

**Pros:**
- Immediate purchase without waiting for auctions and faster process to shipping
- Includes high-resolution car photos

**Cons:**
- Not all stock cars include an auction inspection sheet. In such cases, the inspection is carried out by the exporter, without independent third-party verification, which reduces transparency regarding potential vehicle issues.

### Buying from Auction

**What it is:** You participate in real-time car auctions through the exporter’s bidding system.

**Pros:**
- Full transparency of auction price and fees. You pay the actual auction hammer price plus fixed exporter fees
- Auctions provide third-party verified condition reports

**Cons:**
- Requires more active involvement in browsing and bidding
- Slightly longer timeline


## Communication with the exporter when buying from auction

1. You register an account on the exporter's website
2. You pay a refundable deposit (typically around €1000) to start bidding
3. You browse upcoming auctions and place bids on vehicles of interest
4. Once you win a car at auction, the exporter prepares an invoice
5. You pay 50% of the car price
6. Exporter arranges pickup and transport to the port (Yokohama, Tokyo, Nagoya, or Osaka)
7. The exporter sends you high-resolution photos
8. The exporter completes export customs procedures in Japan and books shipping to Larnaca/Limassol
9. After the car is loaded onto the ship, you pay the remaining balance (car price + exporter fees + shipping)
10. The exporter sends you original documents by DHL to your address in Cyprus
